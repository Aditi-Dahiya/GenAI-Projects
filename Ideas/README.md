# Ideas Page
Generative AI is a domain with endless possibilities, the only limit is your imagination.
And even if all of us can't create all the ideas in our heads in code maybe there are people out there who can help, so why not share your ideas? Why not ask for help and why not make your ideas a reality?

<td>1</td><td>Reciept Based Finance Planner</td><td>A mobile applicaiton which scans a receipt, and auto tags it creates a personalised dashboard, gives investing suggestions and recommendations to improve your finance planning based on your spending. <i>You don't have to share any kind of details like credit or anything just scan the recipt like a qr and the app will do the rest</i> <br/>
I am not sure but I think we can add a web3 aspect to this as well.
